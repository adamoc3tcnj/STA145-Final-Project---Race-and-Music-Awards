# STA145-Final-Project---Race-and-Music-Awards
In my final project, I chose to analyze the relationship between race of artists and awards they receive for their top charting songs.

##  **Instructions**
To aces and utilize the script, open the "adamoc3-final_project-2.R", whcih contains the code for my project. To acess the dataset, open the "data.csv" file. 

## **Data**
The data collected for our proejct was all the songs, systematically sampled, from Pitchforks, "The 200 Best songs of the 2010s", and data regarding each song was collected from various sources including: Wikipedia, Youtube, Genius, Spotify and Apple Music, Music Charts Archive, riaa, who.sampled, and musicstax. Each unit of analysis was one song, and 200 observations were collected.

Using this data, I wanted to determine if there is a relationship between the race of the main artist on their top charting song, as well as if they recieve any sort of award for their song.

## **Operationalization**
The concept of the race of a songs main artist was operationalized in a simillar way, by using a qualtative coding scheme scale from 1-6 different races; A 1 would indicate a black artist, 2 a white artist, 3 a latin artist, 4 an asian artist, 5 a mixed artist, and 6 would indicate a artist of different/unlisted race.

The concept of awards recived for the listed songs was operationalized through a qualatative coding scheme from 1-2; 1 indicating yes an award was recieved, and 2 implying no award was recieved for the said song.
